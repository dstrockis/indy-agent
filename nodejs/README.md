# Run the node.js reference agent

## Migration Notice

**The work of creating interoperable Agents has moved to the Hyperledger Aries Project. This agent implementation is
currently unmaintained. The protocols used here are no longer up-to-date with the standards discussed in the Hyperledger
Aries Project.**

Refer to [the main README][2] for more information on the other components of the Indy Agent repository.

#### Superseding Project(s)
No codebase yet exists that directly supersedes the Node.js agent. However, discussion around creating a Node.js Agent
Framework are being held in the Aries Community. Direct questions about these efforts to the [Hyperledger Rocket.Chat
Aries channel][1].

#### Other questions?
Direct any other questions you may have about this repository to the [Aries channel][1].

* `localhost:3000` for Government
* `localhost:3001` for Alice
* `localhost:3002` for Bob
* `localhost:3003` for Faber University
* `localhost:3004` for Acme Corporation
* `localhost:3005` for Thrift Bank 

### Example cred offer

```json
{"average":"3.8","degree":"Mech Eng","name":"Alice","year":"2013","status":"Available"}
```

### Example proof reqeust

```json
// replace cred_def_id with one output by logging

{"name":"MyDef-Proof","version":"0.1","requested_attributes":{"attr_1_referent":{"name":"degree","restrictions":[{"cred_def_id":"EsgY7i4kD83HoeE2kNbp21:3:CL:203:MyDef"}]}},"requested_predicates":{}}
